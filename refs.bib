  abstract = {Visual working memory (VWM) is one of the most investigated
  cognitive systems functioning as a hub between low- and high-level processes.
  Remarkably, its role in human cognitive architecture makes it a stage of
  crucial importance for the study of socio-affective cognition, also in
  relation with psychopathology such as anxiety. Among socio-affective stimuli,
  faces occupy a place of first importance. How faces and facial expressions are
  encoded and maintained in VWM is the focus of this review. Within the main
  theoretical VWM models, we will review research comparing VWM representations
  of faces and of other classes of stimuli. We will further present previous
  work investigating if and how both static (i.e., ethnicity, trustworthiness
  and identity) and changeable (i.e., facial expressions) facial features are
  represented in VWM. Finally, we will examine research showing qualitative
  differences in VWM for face representations as a function of psychopathology
  and personality traits. The findings that we will review are not always
  coherent with each other, and for this reason we will highlight the main
  methodological differences as the main source of inconsistency. Finally, we
  will provide some suggestions for future research in this field in order to
  foster our understanding of representation of faces in VWM and its potential
  role in supporting socio-affective cognition.},

  abstract = {Several previous studies have interfered with the observer's
  facial mimicry during a variety of facial expression recognition tasks
  providing evidence in favor of the role of facial mimicry and sensorimotor
  activity in emotion processing. In this theoretical context, a particularly
  intriguing facet has been neglected, namely whether blocking facial mimicry
  modulates conscious perception of facial expressions of emotions. To address
  this issue, we used a binocular rivalry paradigm, in which two dissimilar
  stimuli presented to the two eyes alternatingly dominate conscious perception.
  On each trial, female participants (N = 32) were exposed to a rivalrous pair
  of a neutral and a happy expression of the same individual through anaglyph
  glasses in two conditions: in one, they could freely use their facial mimicry,
  in the other they had to keep a chopstick between their lips, constraining the
  mobility of the zygomatic muscle and producing 'noise' for sensorimotor
  simulation. We found that blocking facial mimicry affected the perceptual
  dominance in terms of cumulative time favoring neutral faces, but it did not
  change the time before the first dominance was established. Taken together,
  our results open a door to future investigation of the intersection between
  sensorimotor simulation models and conscious perception of emotional facial
  expressions.},

  abstract = {The relationship between consciousness and working memory (WM) has
  been recently debated both at the theoretical and methodological levels
  (Persuh et al., 2018; Velichkovsky, 2017). While there is behavioral and
  neural evidence that argues for the existence of unconscious WM, several
  methodological concerns have been raised, rendering this issue highly
  controversial. To address the robustness of the previous findings, here we
  adopt a meta-analytic approach to estimate the effect size and heterogeneity
  of the previously reported unconscious WM results, also including unpublished
  results. We used meta-regression to isolate relevant experimental variables,
  in particular, consciousness manipulation and the WM paradigm to identify the
  source of the heterogeneity in the reported effect size of the unconscious WM.
  Our meta-analysis supports the existence of the unconscious WM effect and
  critically reveals several experimental variables that contribute to relevant
  heterogeneity. Our analysis clarifies several theoretical and methodological
  issues. We recommend that future studies explicitly operationalize the
  definition of consciousness, standardize the methodology and systematically
  explore the role of critical variables for the unconscious WM effect.},

  abstract = {According to predictive models of emotion, people use previous
  experience to construct affective predictions, represented multimodally in the
  brain. We do not live in a stable world, however. Some environments are
  uncertain, whereas others are not. In two experiments we investigated how
  experiencing previous certain versus uncertain contingencies shaped subjective
  reactions to future affective stimuli, within and across sensory modalities.
  Two S1-S2 paradigms were used as learning and test phases. S1s were colored
  circles, S2s negative/neutral affective pictures or sounds. During the
  learning phase, participants (N = 192, 179) were assigned to the certain (CG)
  or uncertain group (UG) and presented with 100\% (CG) or 50\% (UG) S1-S2
  congruency between visual stimuli. During the test phase, participants were
  presented with a new 75\% S1-S2 paradigm and visual (Experiment 1) or auditory
  (Experiment 2) S2s. Participants were asked to rate the expected valence of
  upcoming S2s (expectancy ratings) or valence and arousal to S2s. In both
  experiments, the CG reported more extreme expectancy ratings than the UG,
  suggesting that experiencing previous reliable S1-S2 associations led CG
  participants to subsequently predict similar associations. No group
  differences emerged on valence and arousal ratings, which were more
  prominently influenced by the new 75\% contingencies of the test phase rather
  than by previous learned contingencies. Last, comparing the two experiments,
  no significant group by experiment interaction was found, supporting the
  hypothesis of cross-modality generalization at the subjective level. Overall,
  our results advance knowledge about the mechanisms by which previous learned
  contingencies shape subjective affective experience. (PsycInfo Database Record

  abstract = {With the advent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-Corona
  Virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, the theme of emotion recognition from
  facial expressions has become highly relevant due to the widespread use of
  face masks as one of the main devices imposed to counter the spread of the
  virus. Unsurprisingly, several studies published in the last 2 years have
  shown that accuracy in the recognition of basic emotions expressed by faces
  wearing masks is reduced. However, less is known about the impact that wearing
  face masks has on the ability to recognize emotions from subtle expressions.
  Furthermore, even less is known regarding the role of interindividual
  differences (such as alexithymic and autistic traits) in emotion processing.
  This study investigated the perception of all the six basic emotions (anger,
  disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise), both as a function of the
  face mask and as a function of the facial expressions’ intensity (full vs.
  subtle) in terms of participants’ uncertainty in their responses,
  misattribution errors, and perceived intensity. The experiment was conducted
  online on a large sample of participants (N = 129). Participants completed the
  20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale and the Autistic Spectrum Quotient and then
  performed an emotion-recognition task that involved face stimuli wearing a
  mask or not, and displaying full or subtle expressions. Each face stimulus was
  presented alongside the Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW), and participants had to
  indicate what emotion they believed the other person was feeling and its
  intensity using the GEW. For each combination of our variables, we computed
  the indices of ‘uncertainty’ (i.e., the spread of responses around the correct
  emotion category), ‘bias’ (i.e., the systematic errors in recognition), and
  ‘perceived intensity’ (i.e., the distance from the center of the GEW). We
  found that face masks increase uncertainty for all facial expressions of
  emotion, except for fear when intense, and that disgust was systematically
  confused with anger (i.e., response bias). Furthermore, when faces were
  covered by the mask, all the emotions were perceived as less intense, and this
  was particularly evident for subtle expressions. Finally, we did not find any
  evidence of a relationship between these indices and alexithymic/autistic
  traits.},

  or underdevelopment of cranial nerves VII and VI, leading to facial palsy and
  impaired lateral eye movements. As a result, MBS individuals cannot produce
  facial expressions and did not develop motor programs for facial expressions.
  In the latest model of sensorimotor simulation, an iterative communication
  between somatosensory, motor/premotor cortices, and visual regions has been
  proposed, which should allow more efficient discriminations among subtle
  facial expressions. Accordingly, individuals with congenital facial motor
  disability, specifically with MBS, should exhibit atypical communication
  within this network. Here, we aimed to test this facet of the sensorimotor
  simulation models. We estimated the functional connectivity between the visual
  cortices for face processing and the sensorimotor cortices in healthy and MBS
  individuals. To this aim, we studied the strength of beta band functional
  connectivity between these two systems using high-density EEG, combined with a
  change detection task with facial expressions (and a control condition
  involving non-face stimuli). The results supported our hypothesis such that
  when discriminating subtle facial expressions, participants affected by
  congenital facial palsy (compared to healthy controls) showed reduced
  connectivity strength between sensorimotor regions and visual regions for face
  processing. This effect was absent for the condition with non-face stimuli.
  These findings support sensorimotor simulation models and the communication
  between sensorimotor and visual areas during subtle facial expression
  processing.},
